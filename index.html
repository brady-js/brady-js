        <p>
          Hi there, thanks for visiting my website. In this section I will be
          revealing information about who I am, what brought me to coding, and
          why I chose this as my career. Enjoy!
        </p>

        <h3>The man behind the code</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Brady Heath. I'm twenty-two years old. I come from an
          extremely small town called Pink Hill in North Carolina. It is an
          extremely ruran area, where not many web developers come from.
          However, technology has always been something that has intrigued me. I
          have been to school for welding, worked as an industrial maintenance
          mechanic, and worked with my hands for years. I've decided to teach
          myself coding and web development as part of my future career path.
          This is something that has been a dream of mine for a while now, and
          now I'm finally starting to take the steps to achieve my goal.
        </p>

        <h3>What got me into coding?</h3>
        <p>
          People have asked me why I want to learn code. My answer is, I'm
          simply driven to do so. I love the idea of coming up with solutions to
          every day problems, no matter the complexity of them. I believe with
          coding you can help others, design really cool and interesting things,
          solve a problem in a program or website to make it more user friendly.
          Another thing that brought me to coding is I love the idea of being
          able to do freelance work or go make tons of money working for a big
          tech or software company.
        </p>

        <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
        <p>
          My goals are to become a full-stack developer and be able to build
          full websites from start to finish without any help. However, I do not
          mind and would love to have the opportunity to work with a team of
          developers. Right now I'm mainly focused on learning Front-End, (HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript), then once I'm proficient in Front-End, I plan on
          learning more about full stack development and integrating back-end
          along the way.

        <p>
          In this section you will be able to view all of my recent projects
          which will include websites and applications I have built. For right
          now this is empty as I am still learning and will build new things as
          I learn. Look forward to seeing a lot in the future.
